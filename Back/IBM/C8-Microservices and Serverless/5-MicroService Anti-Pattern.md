# Microservices Anti-Patterns

While there are many patterns for doing microservices well, an equally significant number of patterns exist that can quickly get any development team into trouble. The following are some of the **don‚Äôts** while developing microservices:

---

## ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Build Microservices (Too Early)

The first rule of microservices is **don‚Äôt start with microservices**.

- Begin with a monolith until it becomes too large or complex to manage effectively.
- Only consider refactoring into microservices when:
  - The monolith‚Äôs complexity hinders development and maintenance.
  - You **feel the pain** of slow updates, tight coupling, or scaling issues.

> Until then, you likely don‚Äôt even have a monolith that needs breaking up.

---

## ‚ùå Not Taking Automation Seriously

With monoliths, you deploy a single application. With microservices, each service may have:

- Different **codebases**
- Separate **test pipelines**
- Unique **deploy cycles**

Without proper **automation** or **managed cloud services**, you'll face:

- Increased operational complexity
- Higher risk of deployment failures

‚úÖ **Solution**: Always use **DevOps pipelines**, **CI/CD**, and **cloud-native automation tools**.

## ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Build Nanoservices

Going too far with microservices leads to **nanoservices** ‚Äî services that are:

- Too small to be independently useful
- Overly complex to manage collectively

üìå Prefer **larger services**, and split them further **only when necessary**, such as when:

- Deploying changes becomes difficult
- Data models become overly complex
- Performance suffers from uneven scaling

---

## ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Turn Into SOA

Microservices ‚â† SOA.

- Both involve **reusable services**, but:
  - **SOA** tends to be heavyweight and enterprise-wide.
  - **Microservices** emphasize **fine-grained**, independently deployed units with **separate data storage** (bounded context).

> If your microservices begin to look like a traditional SOA system, you may face scalability and agility issues.

---

## ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Build a Gateway for Each Service

Avoid embedding these in each service:

- Authentication
- Throttling
- Orchestration
- Routing
- Transformation
- Analytics

‚úÖ **Use an API Gateway** to centralize these concerns.

- Acts as a **middleware layer** between clients and services
- Simplifies operations and standardizes access control, monitoring, and routing

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The **goal** of microservices is to:

- Enhance **customer experience**
- Be **flexible** to new requirements
- **Reduce costs** by delivering business functionality through fine-grained services

But to achieve these benefits, avoid the above **anti-patterns**. Otherwise, microservices could become more of a **burden** than a solution.
