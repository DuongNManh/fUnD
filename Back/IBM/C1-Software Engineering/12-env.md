# 🚀 Application Deployment Environments

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After this guide, you will be able to:

- List different types of **pre-production environments** and their purposes
- Distinguish **production** from other environments
- Compare **on-premises**, **public**, **private**, and **hybrid cloud** deployment options

---

## 🌍 What is an Application Environment?

An **application environment** includes all the **hardware and software resources** needed to run an app:

🧱 Components:

- Application code or executables
- Required libraries, modules, third-party tools, middleware
- Operating system (OS)
- Networking and infrastructure
- Physical or virtual hardware: CPU, memory, storage

---

## 🧪 Pre-Production Environments

Used throughout the **application development lifecycle** before it reaches real users.

### 1. Development Environment

- Where active **coding** happens
- Often on the **developer’s workstation**

📊 **Diagram**:

```
[Developer Workstation] → [Dev Environment]
```

---

### 2. QA (Quality Assurance) / Testing Environment

- Used by QA teams to **test** application components
- Separate from development to ensure reproducibility

📊 **Diagram**:

```
[Build] → [QA/Test Environment] → [Test Results]
```

---

### 3. Staging Environment

- **Replica** of production environment
- Final test bed before going live
- No real users; used for pre-launch validation

📊 **Diagram**:

```
[QA Passed Code] → [Staging Environment] ≈ [Production Environment]
```

---

## 🏁 Production Environment

This is where the **live version** of the app runs and is used by **actual users**.

📦 Includes:

- Full software & hardware stack
- Load balancing & scalability
- Security and reliability
- Robust infrastructure for high availability

📊 **Diagram**:

```
[General Users] ⇄ [Production Environment]
                      |
         ┌────────────┴────────────┐
         |    App Servers          |
         |    Database Servers     |
         |    Security Measures    |
         |    Load Balancers       |
         └────────────────────────┘
```

🧠 **Key Considerations**:

- Must handle thousands/millions of users
- Must meet **non-functional requirements**:

  - ✅ Security
  - ✅ Reliability
  - ✅ Scalability
  - ✅ Performance

---

## 📦 Deployment Options

### 🔐 On-Premises Deployment

- All infrastructure is **physically hosted** on-site
- Behind organization’s **firewall**
- **Full control**, but also **higher cost and maintenance**

📊 **Diagram**:

```
[User] ⇄ [On-Prem Data Center] (Managed by Organization)
```

✅ Pros: Control, security
⚠️ Cons: Cost, maintenance, limited scalability

---

### ☁️ Public Cloud Deployment

- Runs on **shared infrastructure** over the **internet**
- Managed by cloud providers (e.g., **AWS**, **Azure**, **Google Cloud**, **IBM Cloud**)

📊 **Diagram**:

```
[User] ⇄ [Public Cloud Provider (Shared Infra)]
```

✅ Pros: Cost-effective, scalable
⚠️ Cons: Less control, potential compliance risks

---

### 🏢 Private Cloud Deployment

- Cloud infrastructure for **exclusive use** by one organization
- Can be **on-premises** or hosted by a provider

📊 **Diagram**:

```
[User] ⇄ [Private Cloud Provider (Dedicated Infra)]
```

✅ Pros: Customization, security
⚠️ Cons: Costlier than public cloud

---

### 🌐 Hybrid Cloud Deployment

- **Combination** of public and private clouds
- Optimizes **cost**, **security**, and **flexibility**

📊 **Diagram**:

```
      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
      | Public Cloud| ⇄⇄⇄ | Private Cloud|
      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
               ↑                   ↑
              [App] uses both as needed
```

✅ Pros: Flexible, balanced approach
⚠️ Cons: Complex setup and management

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Environment | Purpose            | Example Use                         |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Development | Active coding      | Developer workstation               |
| QA/Testing  | Functional testing | Test new features & bug fixes       |
| Staging     | Final validation   | Replicate production before release |
| Production  | Live user access   | Actual end-users                    |

| Deployment Model | Description                     | Pros                          | Cons                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| On-Premises      | Hosted internally               | Security, full control        | High cost, self-managed  |
| Public Cloud     | Shared external provider        | Scalable, cost-effective      | Less control             |
| Private Cloud    | Exclusive virtual infra         | Secure, customizable          | Expensive, limited scale |
| Hybrid Cloud     | Combines public & private infra | Balanced, optimized for needs | Complex to manage        |

---

## 🧠 Final Notes

- Use **development → QA → staging → production** as a reliable flow
- Choose the right **deployment model** based on:

  - Security needs
  - Budget
  - Scalability
  - Control and compliance
