# 🧠 Introduction to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- ✅ Define what the SDLC is
- ✅ Describe its history and evolution
- ✅ Discuss the advantages of using SDLC

## 🌀 What is the SDLC?

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a **systematic process** used to develop **high-quality software** within a **predictable timeframe** and **budget**.

Its main goal is to **meet business requirements** through a structured and repeatable development workflow.

> 📌 SDLC is not a coding technique — it is a **framework** for managing the **entire lifecycle** of software development.

## 🕰️ A Brief History

| Period       | Development                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1960s–1970s  | Rise of large-scale software systems                  |
| Initial SDLC | Based on **Waterfall Model** — linear, phase-by-phase |
| Modern       | **Iterative** methods like Agile, Spiral              |

As software complexity grew, companies needed a more **disciplined, phase-driven approach** — thus the SDLC emerged.

## 🔁 Common SDLC Phases

Each SDLC methodology (like Waterfall, Agile, or Spiral) contains several key **phases**. These will be discussed in detail in the next lesson, but the typical structure looks like this:

          +---------------------+
          |   Requirements      |
          +----------+----------+
                     |
                     ▼
          +---------------------+
          |     Design          |
          +----------+----------+
                     |
                     ▼
          +---------------------+
          |   Implementation    |
          +----------+----------+
                     |
                     ▼
          +---------------------+
          |     Testing         |
          +----------+----------+
                     |
                     ▼
          +---------------------+
          |   Deployment & Ops  |
          +----------+----------+
                     |
                     ▼
          +---------------------+
          |  Maintenance/Review |
          +---------------------+
```

> 🔄 **Iteration is key** in modern SDLC. After maintenance, new requirements may restart the cycle.

## 💡 Key Advantages of Using the SDLC

| Benefit                   | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Structured Process     | Provides a consistent roadmap, avoids ad hoc development                  |
| ✅ Defined Phases         | Clarifies team tasks and roles at every stage                             |
| ✅ Improved Communication | Enhances stakeholder and developer alignment                              |
| ✅ Supports Iteration     | Allows revisiting earlier phases to refine requirements                   |
| ✅ Risk Mitigation        | Identifies and addresses problems early (e.g., during design, not coding) |
| ✅ Accountability         | Roles and responsibilities are well-defined                               |

## 🧩 Example Scenario

Imagine a team building a web-based product listing app. Using the SDLC:

```plaintext
      Client Stakeholders
              │
              ▼
      +------------------+
      | Requirements     |
      +------------------+
              │
              ▼
      +------------------+
      | UI & API Design  |
      +------------------+
              │
              ▼
      +---------------------------+
      | Backend Implementation    |
      | (Node.js / Python / etc)  |
      +---------------------------+
              │
              ▼
      +------------------+
      | QA Testing       |
      +------------------+
              │
              ▼
      +------------------+
      | Deploy to Cloud  |
      +------------------+
              │
              ▼
      +------------------+
      | Monitoring & Fix |
      +------------------+
```

> 🔎 In this example, every stage feeds the next — and problems discovered later may loop the process back to earlier stages.

## ✅ Summary

- The **SDLC** provides a systematic process for software development.
- It was born from the need to manage the complexity of software projects in the 1960s.
- The SDLC helps reduce risk, improve efficiency, and increase communication.
- Modern versions of SDLC (Agile, Spiral, DevOps) allow for flexibility and iteration.
- Each team member has clearly defined roles, reducing ambiguity and overlaps.
