# Interpreted and Compiled Programming Languages

After reviewing this topic, you'll be able to:

- Identify **interpreted programming languages**
- Identify **compiled programming languages**

## üß† What Are Programming Languages?

Programming languages help us tell computers what to do. Since machines understand **binary (1s and 0s)**, we use **human-readable programming languages** to communicate with them.

There are two broad categories of programming languages:

```
+------------------------+------------------------+
| Interpreted Languages | Compiled Languages      |
+------------------------+------------------------+
| Python                 | C, C++, C#             |
| JavaScript             | Java                   |
| HTML                   |                        |
| Lua                    |                        |
+------------------------+------------------------+
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Interpreted Languages

Also called **scripting languages**, interpreted languages require an **interpreter** to execute code.

The **interpreter** reads the human-readable code **line-by-line** and executes it directly.

### üß≠ Key Features

- Easy to test and debug
- More portable (runs across different platforms)
- Slower execution compared to compiled languages

### üîß Examples of Interpreted Languages

```
+------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Language   | Usage                                        |
+------------+----------------------------------------------+
| JavaScript | Browser interactivity                        |
| Python     | General-purpose, popular in data science     |
| Lua        | Lightweight scripting, popular in games      |
| HTML       | Web page structure and formatting            |
+------------+----------------------------------------------+
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Compiled Languages

Compiled languages are used for building full applications and operating systems. The source code is **converted to machine code once**, producing a **single executable file**.

### üß≠ Key Features

- Faster execution speed
- Requires compilation before execution
- Better optimization for large applications

### üîß Examples of Compiled Languages

```
+--------+---------------------------------------------+
| C/C++  | System programming (Windows, macOS, Linux)  |
| C#     | Microsoft ecosystem, desktop & web apps     |
| Java   | Android development, cross-platform backend |
+--------+---------------------------------------------+
```

## üñ±Ô∏è Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're cooking:

- **Interpreted** = Following the recipe step-by-step as you read it
- **Compiled** = Preparing a ready-to-eat meal in advance and just serving it

## üß† Summary

| Feature     | Interpreted              | Compiled              |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Execution   | Line-by-line             | All at once           |
| Speed       | Slower                   | Faster                |
| Portability | High                     | Depends on platform   |
| Examples    | JavaScript, Python, HTML | C, C++, Java          |
| Use Case    | Web, small scripts       | Full applications, OS |
