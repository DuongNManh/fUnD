# üåê Back-End Development: How the Web Works Behind the Scenes

Back-end development focuses on everything that happens behind the user interface of a website or a cloud app. While front-end developers build what users see, **back-end developers** build the logic, data handling, and infrastructure that power those user experiences.

---

## üéØ What Is Back-End Development?

Back-end developers create and manage all the **server-side resources** needed to respond to requests made through a web app or cloud app. Their tasks include:

- Handling data processing
- Interfacing with databases
- Managing user authentication and authorization
- Enabling APIs and routes
- Securing sensitive data

---

## üîÅ Collaboration with Front-End Developers

Back-end and front-end developers **must work closely together**:

- Before development: to align requirements and integration points
- During development: to resolve bugs, exchange API endpoints, and handle responses
- After deployment: to maintain and enhance functionality

## üõí Example: Online Shopping Workflow

Let‚Äôs follow what happens when a user shops online:

```plaintext
+---------------------+       +-------------------+       +----------------------+
|      Front-End      | ----> |   Web Application | ----> |      Database        |
| (User Interface)    |       |   (Back-End Code) |       | (Products, Users...) |
+---------------------+       +-------------------+       +----------------------+

1. User searches for a product
2. Search is sent to back-end
3. Back-end queries database
4. Result returned and displayed
```

---

## üîê Back-End Roles and Responsibilities

When a user performs actions like **logging in, placing an order, or submitting payment info**, the back-end is responsible for:

- Processing the request
- Validating user permissions
- Retrieving or saving data securely

---

## üîå APIs, Routes, and Endpoints

Back-end developers enable communication via APIs and routing mechanisms:

| Term         | Description                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **API**      | Set of rules and functions for exchanging data (commonly in JSON or XML) |
| **Route**    | The path the app follows to trigger logic or return data (`/products`)   |
| **Endpoint** | A destination on the server where the front-end sends requests           |

üîé **Example**

```http
GET /api/products/123 ‚Üí Returns product info from server
POST /api/login       ‚Üí Authenticates user credentials
```

If the endpoint doesn't exist, the server returns a `404 Not Found` error.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used in Back-End Development

Back-end developers must be familiar with at least one **server-side language** and its ecosystem.

### üìå JavaScript (Node.js & Express)

```plaintext
- Node.js: Enables JS on the server
- Express: Simplifies API routing and middleware
```

**Sample Route in Express.js:**

```javascript
app.get("/api/products/:id", (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.params.id;
  // Fetch product from database
  res.json({ id: productId, name: "Sample Product" });
});
```

---

### üêç Python (Django & Flask)

```plaintext
- Django: Full-featured, batteries-included web framework
- Flask: Lightweight, flexible micro-framework
```

**Sample Route in Flask:**

```python
@app.route('/api/users/<int:id>')
def get_user(id):
    user = get_user_by_id(id)
    return jsonify(user)
```

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Working with Databases

Back-end developers interact with **databases** using:

- **SQL** for raw queries
- **ORM (Object Relational Mapping)** for cleaner code and abstraction

```plaintext
SQL Example:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 123;

ORM (Python SQLAlchemy):
Product.query.get(123)
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Responsibilities

Back-end developers handle:

- Storing passwords securely (e.g., bcrypt, hashing)
- Securing payment data (e.g., using HTTPS, encryption)
- Preventing attacks like SQL injection, CSRF, etc.

---

## üì± Responsive Back-End Design

Back-end logic supports **multi-device access** and **secure services**, allowing clients from:

- Web browsers
- Mobile apps
- IoT devices

...to interact with the same back-end API.
