# AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

## Overview

An **EC2 instance** is a virtual machine (VM) that runs in the AWS Cloud. When launching an instance, you decide the virtual hardware configuration by choosing an instance type.

Each instance type offers different combinations of:

- **Compute** power
- **Memory** capacity
- **Storage** options

## Instance Families

Instance types are grouped into **instance families**, with each family optimized for specific use cases. Instance families have sub-families that are grouped by combination of processor and storage types.

### Key Terms

- **vCPU**: Virtual CPU represents a thread of the underlying physical CPU core (1 vCPU = 1 Thread)

## Instance Categories

AWS offers **5 main instance categories**:

### 1. General Purpose

**Use Case**: Balanced compute, memory, and networking resources

**Ideal for**:

- Web servers
- Code repositories

### 2. Compute Optimized

**Use Case**: Compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors

**Ideal for**:

- Batch processing workloads
- Media transcoding
- High performance web servers
- High performance computing (HPC)
- Scientific modeling
- Dedicated gaming servers and ad server engines
- Machine learning (ML) inference

### 3. Memory Optimized

**Use Case**: Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory

### 4. Storage Optimized

**Use Case**: Workloads requiring high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage

### 5. Accelerated Computing

**Use Case**: Hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform functions more efficiently than software running on CPUs

**Examples**:

- Floating point number calculations
- Graphics processing
- Data pattern matching

## Instance Sizing

Instance sizing is based on the combined hardware resources consumed by that instance type:

- vCPU capacity
- Memory capacity
- Storage capacity
- Networking capacity

## Additional Instance Characteristics

Instance names can include additional capabilities indicated by specific letters:

| Letter | Characteristic             |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| **a**  | AMD processors             |
| **g**  | AWS Graviton processors    |
| **i**  | Intel processors           |
| **d**  | Instance store volumes     |
| **n**  | Network optimization       |
| **b**  | Block storage optimization |
| **e**  | Extra storage or memory    |
| **z**  | High frequency             |
